One of the most difficult things about bootstrapping a startup is the financial uncertainty. When will my company make money? _Will_ my company make money? If it does, will it be enough to support my company’s operations _and_ the people involved? 

Anyone who has experience with startups knows that it’s not just something you do to make money. Many may do it in hopes of being wildly successful, but the odds are stacked against us. But I’m not here to discuss startup financials.

It doesn’t happen often, but every now and then I will come across a startup, nonprofit, or other organization with a heart-wrenching, awe-inspiring mission. And I want to help support them.  Sadly, bootstrapping a startup typically impedes any nonessential spending. 

Since it’s rare that a mission speaks to me on a fundamental level, I’ve started keeping a list. Anytime I encounter a cause that moves me, I jot it down. Even though I can’t contribute right now, these causes are truly worthy. I believe that much of my life will be devoted to helping philanthropic causes, and I look forward to the day that it becomes a reality. 

In case you’re curious, here’s my short list so far:

* [GMin](http://www.gmin.org/)
* [Charity: Water](http://www.charitywater.org/)
* [Cleveland Clinic](http://my.clevelandclinic.org/default.aspx)
