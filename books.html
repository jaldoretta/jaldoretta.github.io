						<p><em>The Cycle</em> explores the complex relationship between society and menstruation, and suggests ways in which we can help overcome the burdens of menstrual-related stigmas faced by women. I seek to break down this stigma by educating readers on the many benefits of a natural menstrual cycle, including natural and highly-effective pregnancy prevention, pregnancy assistance, maintenance of gynecological health, and timely diagnosis of many reproductive disorders.</p>
						<p><em>The Cycle</em> will teach you the details of practicing the sympto-thermal method of fertility awareness for these purposes, and along the way will hopefully make the taboo topic of menstruation feel a little more human. I am so passionate about this subject that I have made the book <a class="body-text-link" href="https://www.readytogroove.com/the-cycle/">available for free</a>.</p>
