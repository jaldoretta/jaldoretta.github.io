Jessica,

From the very bottom of my heart, thank you. On transformative days in my life, I go to sleep at night and, without fail, find myself reliving the events of that day. Tonight was different.

As expected, my dreams were filled with the inspiring talks I heard at YC&rsquo;s female founders conference and the incredible women I was fortunate enough to meet by attending. But what I wasn&rsquo;t expecting was sitting up in bed at 4:30 a.m., completely wide awake, with my mind racing and practically bursting at the seams. You see, I really had no choice but to write you this letter.

If I&rsquo;m being honest, I&rsquo;ve had my doubts about YC. *Is YC **really** passionate about supporting female founders?* I&rsquo;ve lived my life in a &ldquo;man&rsquo;s world,&rdquo; receiving a degree in mechanical engineering&mdash;which contains the <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ngcproject.org/statistics">lowest percentage of women</a> compared to any other engineering field at just 7.2%&mdash;from an already <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/georgia-tech-1569">male-dominated university</a>. And now, I&rsquo;m a female founder in what many days feels like a &ldquo;boy&rsquo;s club&rdquo; industry, trying to solve a <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.readytogroove.com/the-cycle">women&rsquo;s issue</a>. It can be difficult not to get a little jaded.

But, like you, I pride myself on my judge of character. I can&rsquo;t explain it, but it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s always come naturally to me. So when I was waiting alongside twenty other eager women after the conference for my chance to introduce myself, and I saw you laughing and interacting with other FCC attendees, every doubt I ever held about YC suddenly felt as though it had never existed to begin with.

The same love that shined when Grace Garey spoke about <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.watsi.org">Watsi</a> was bursting from you as you gave advice, cracked jokes, and laughed with FCC attendees. And I realized it&rsquo;s simply not possible for this empire you&rsquo;ve helped create not to live, breathe, and reflect that very same love.

To say that FCC was transformative would really not be doing my experience justice. I&rsquo;ve always known that I wanted to help people and help change the world, and I&rsquo;ve always been fairly confident I&rsquo;d be successful. But as I sit here in the dark waiting for the sun to peek over the city of San Francisco, confidence no longer describes what I feel. My mindset has shifted to *certainty*.

I see myself so clearly on stage at a future YC female founders conference, sharing *my story* about <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.readytogroove.com">a company</a> and a cause I plan to devote the rest of my life to, beaming with that same love I feel every single day when I wake up to go to work.  

A lot of people would probably say that I&rsquo;m crazy and self-centered for saying that. But I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything crazy or self-centered about wanting to inspire others to find the thing that makes them beam the way I do when I think about the change I want my company to create, or the way Grace does when she talks about Watsi, or the way you do when you&rsquo;re surrounded by passionate founders.

So, thank you, Jessica, for showing me what YC is really about, and for showing me what I&rsquo;ve always known about myself but never had the audacity to fully embrace.

I&rsquo;ll see you on stage.


Sincerely,

Jennifer
