Even after spending five years of my life at Georgia Tech, I graduated as a mechanical engineer with a marginal understanding of how to code. I took several programming courses as a student, and although I managed to get by, I was left with a sour taste in my mouth. 

The courses had everything one would expect from a world-renowned engineering school: a professor whose intelligence made you feel like a primate, homework that required a pep-talk just to start, exams that made you question your decision to study engineering, and a curriculum that was structured to a tee. And I did everything right: I studied hard, I completed my assignments, I learned how to solve some fairly complex equations using code, and I ended up acing the class. But I was not inspired. Something was missing, and I found myself lacking motivation. Not a motivation to succeed in the class, but a motivation to grow and explore as a programmer.

If you had asked me back then whether I liked programming, I almost certainly would have said “no”. Maybe even “hell no”. Yet now I find myself unable to satiate my hunger for this very subject. So what changed?

Although I could talk for hours about how society’s gender stereotypes contributed to my coding delay, I think a large part of the difference has been the context of my learning. As a student, I was given a very specific set of requirements: solve this math problem, generate this chart, write a function that does x, y, and z. While I’m sure those can all be very effective ways to teach the basics of programming, a vital ingredient was omitted. I felt no joy or satisfaction in “solving” these problems. I felt no desire to code beyond the bounds of our narrow curriculum. 

I partially blame myself for not seeing more possibilities in programming. But I also blame the universities (and institutes) that structure their curriculums to mold students to fit a pre-determined norm. For those students who aren’t inherently excited about programming (or, perhaps, feel that it’s boring or difficult), these structured courses seem only to perpetuate our ingrained discomfort. Had I not set aside my reservations and given programming another shot after quitting my job as an engineer, I might never have discovered my love for the craft. 

And while I applaud and commend schools like Georgia Tech for staying ahead of the education curve by experimenting with courses structured outside of what is typical, there is still much more to be done. Their recognition that greater student success will come from challenging the current system of education is imperative. Focusing on self-direction, and measuring success in terms of student growth rather than benchmarks, will produce young adults who are capable of creating systemic change rather than disappearing into the current corporate environment. 

Career pools are changing rapidly in favor of technology-related jobs, and unless we want unemployment rates to continue down a path of growth, the structure of education has to change to meet this demand.

It was only after I left that structured learning environment that I discovered the many benefits of knowing how to code. Having the ability to learn at my own pace, writing code that *I* wanted to write, and not feeling an intense external pressure to write the perfect program (because failing is just as important as succeeding) all empowered me to thrive and explore the true joys of coding. 

I am by no means a strong programmer (yet), but if there’s one thing I took away from school, it’s my unabiding passion for learning. I’ve always known that I wanted to do something important with my life that would have a positive effect on a lot of people, but I never dreamed of finding that in coding. I'm disappointed that the system only hindered that love rather than igniting it and helping it flourish. We must learn to mold our schools rather than our students in order to afford others that same opportunity for self-discovery.
