title:  "In Response to Paul Graham's Essay About Female Founders"

Though much of the recent Paul Graham [controversy](http://valleywag.gawker.com/paul-graham-says-women-havent-been-hacking-for-the-pa-1490581236) about female founders has died down, I still find myself thinking about his [rebuttal](http://paulgraham.com/ff.html).  I was both struck and disappointed by his opening argument: 

>“It's hard to argue I'm biased against female founders when I have a [female cofounder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQJ6zsNCA-4) myself. And with 3 female partners out of 12, YC has slightly over 3x the venture industry average. While 3 out of 12 is not 50-50, it would be very hard to find another firm of our size in the venture business where women run the show to the degree they do at YC.”

What I find disappointing about this argument is the degree to which he is attempting to justify YC’s obvious gender discrepancy. While I certainly won’t argue about the numbers he presents, *more than industry average* does not equal good or balanced. For me, his argument merely makes it apparent that there is still much work to be done to increase female representation in this industry. 3 out of 12 is not a strong showing.

The “I’m not biased because…” argument is absurd. Graham’s argument fails because bias is part of human nature. He is a human and, therefore, he is biased. The same can be said for you. And for me. I walked away from his essay disappointed because his attitude struck me as self-important, as though he is above the inherent flaws of us regular humans.

I’m not claiming that Graham is sexist (I'm sure he's a great guy), but he is most certainly not without bias. And neither is YC. I would have been much more impressed had he recognized this. *Yes, biases still exist in industry and will always exist as long as humans are involved, but me and YC are doing everything we can to decrease the prevalence and influence of those biases.*

>“Are there other things you could do to get girls interested in programming? Almost certainly. Are there other things you'd have to do? Quite possibly. But notice the language I'm using. In the course of writing this I've gone from certainty to uncertainty. That's because I've gone from talking about a topic I know more about than most people—what happens when women start startups—to a topic many people know more about than me.”

I’m really glad Graham said this towards the end of his essay. While it doesn’t make up for his awful opening argument, I was glad to hear him admit that he’s human. But his all-knowing attitude at the beginning of the essay really put a bad taste in my mouth. Yes, he probably knows more about startups than most people. He probably even knows a lot about women starting startups. But to claim that he’s above bias is honestly a little insulting. 

Humans are not perfect, but we *can* remain conscious our biases and work to eliminate their influence over our words and actions. As a very prominent figure in the venture and startup industries, I had hoped Graham would take the more humanizing approach.
