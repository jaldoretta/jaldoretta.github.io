A recent exchange left me unable to ignore a glaring fundamental human flaw: the need to be right. As humans, we instinctively strive for self preservation. In modern society, the survival of the human species (for the most part) no longer relies on avoidance of physical threat. But our instinct for self preservation persists. So rather than fighting for preservation of life, we fight for preservation of character, opinion, and self-interest. 

We ferociously protect what *we believe* to be right. This creates a distaste for collaboration with people of differing viewpoints, and it was hard at work in the individual with whom I had this encounter. But this incident was not unique. We see this self preservation in government officials who are [unwilling to participate in bipartisanship](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/06/15/gridlock-not-likely-to-end-with-112th-congress). We see it in 1%-ers who [evade empathy](http://www.upworthy.com/this-guy-needs-a-clue-a-member-of-the-1-declares-it-great-that-35-billion-are-in-poverty?c=utw1&utm_content=bufferbf668&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) for our country's poorest communities. We see it in organizations that place [financial interest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JykxZxps5Jk&feature=youtu.be) above public safety. 

Worst of all, we tend to rationalize these decisions. We make ourselves believe that we’re doing the world a favor by not engaging with those whose interests and opinions do not closely align with our own. But what we are actually doing is hindering progress and impeding lasting solutions.

It's not always an easy feat to work with those with whom we don't agree. It means that we must accept the prospect of being wrong–that a possibility exists that there are circumstances we, ourselves, have not considered. We must admit that human thinking is flawed–that *our own* thinking is flawed. This idea is directly at odds with our impulse for preservation.

I'm not claiming to be above this flawed thinking. I'm human, after all. But I will say that I have come to recognize the importance of working in situations that challenge my understanding of the world. Without challenge, positive growth is an impossibility. We must learn to approach situations from varying angles, and to recognize that the experiences and biases that have molded our own opinions are not impartial. I believe that every single person has something to teach, and I have committed myself to include these ideas in my work. I am not perfect in the execution of this goal, but my continuing consciousness has done amazing things for my perspective. Do I struggle in my pursuit? Of course. But I think that I will be better off for it.

It can be a scary road to travel, but that's not a good reason to walk another path. This isn’t about being politically correct. It’s about growth, expansion, and lasting solutions.

Challenge yourself to engage with those who push you outside of your comfort zone. Engage in conversations that challenge your biases and your thinking. Engage in work that will be improved by opinions formed by experiences outside of your own...even if you do not agree with those opinions. Realize that human thinking is partial, and, therefore, the products of our work can never truly be impartial. 

Progress is not hindered by approaches to a problem that are not directly in line with our own. Progress is hindered by our unwillingness to expand our own understanding through working with others toward a common goal. If we wish to make lasting change, it is imperative that we recognize the difference.
